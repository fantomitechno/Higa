## What is Higa ?

It's a Discord API package builded by fantomitechno.

## Why a new one as Discord.js exist and is powerfull ?

Just because I want to train myself and doing a project like that can be very interesting. More over, I don't agree with some of the ways Discord.js do some things so as I can't have myself to understand its code to do a fork, I decided to write my own library to do things like I want.

## Finaly, why the name Higa ?

Higa is a character from Swort Art Online (really good anime ðŸ™ƒ) and I wanted a reference to that anime so I thought about the personnages I liked the most : Kayaba, Yui, Eugeo... And after some thinking, I remembered this personnage : a developper for the Fluctlight project, exactly who I wanted ! ^^
