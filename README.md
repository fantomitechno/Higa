# HIGA
## What is Higa ?
It's a random Discord API package builded with randomness by fantomitechno.

## Why a new one as Discord.js exist and is powerfull ?
Just because I want to train myself and doing a project like that can be very interesting

## Finaly, why the name Higa ?
Higa is a character from Swort Art Online (really good anime ðŸ™ƒ) and I wanted a reference to that anime so I thought about the personnages I liked the most : Kayaba, Yui, Eugeo... And after some thinking, I remembered this personnage : a developper for the Fluctlight project, exactly who I wanted ! ^^
